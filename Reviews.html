				<h4>Team Building</h4>
				<h5>"I took on a new job and wanted to get to know my staff better, so I booked a dinner class at 
				Viva Cucina. We prepared a four course meal that was delicious and easy to do. I wasn’t 
				sure everyone would enjoy doing this, but they did. It was nice not having to worry about the meal and 
				getting to spend informal time with my new staff. The culinary staff took care of all the details for me, 
				making it a great evening for everyone."
				<br> - <i>Barclays, San Francisco</i>
				<br>
				<br>
				"For our office's party we decided to try something new and take a cooking class together. She provides aprons and hair 
				ties and then gave us a run down of what we'd be preparing. Breaking off in to teams, we each tackled part of the meal. 
				Along the way, Barbara is there to coach you on the meal prep and help time everything being cooked. In addition to 
				some fun team building, I learned a few valuable tips on properly roasting veggies and making some killer "smashed" 
				potatoes. The meal came out delicious and the best part was the table was set for us and all the clean up done by 
				her and her assistant for the day."
				<br>-<i>Cisco Systems, San Francisco</i></h5>

				<h4>Holiday Staff Events</h4>
				<h5>"I wanted a unique way to spend our office holiday party. Restaurants can be noisy and not conducive to mingling. I booked 
				my office holiday party with Viva Cucina for my staff of 30 and they loved it. Viva Cucina handled everything and Barbara 
				was great to work with. Her staff were very attentive, the food delicious and her place is so big and roomy, which made us 
				feel very comfortable, which is what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend these classes to others."
				<br>- <i> Bryant Surveys, San Ramon</i>
				<br>
				<br>
				"We booked our staff Christmas luncheon here. When we went to the house for a site visit we were impressed with how beautiful 
				and roomy Barbara’s home is. I can see why people enjoy their events here. She has a big backyard for outdoor entertaining and
				cooking. I can’t wait to take a grilling class from Viva Cucina in the summer. The 12 of us had a great time. It was nice being 
				together in a private setting, and we got to take our time cooking and eating. The food was absolutely delicious. We would do 
				this again, hopefully soon."
				<br>-<i>Chevron, San Ramon</i>

			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
				<h4>Couples' Dinner Party</h4>
				<h5>"This is the second time I have had a class at Viva Cucina. My friends and I love learning new recipes and enjoy the time 
				together without the kids. The food was delicious and we love that we can sit down and enjoy the meal at the dining room table.
				Viva Cucina has a beautiful kitchen, dining room and living room, making you feel at home, instead of being in a stuffy restaurant 
				or having one couple hosting the dinner and doing all the work."
				<br>-<i>Christine, Walnut Creek</i>
				<br>
				<br>
				"We like booking our classes in the summer at Viva Cucina because we get to use the backyard Bar-B-Que to cook our meal. I have been
				afraid of using the grill, but Barbara gave us a great class and actual hands-on techniques in using the grill for meats, vegetables 
				and bread. Now I don’t hesitate to use my indoor or outdoor grill."
				<br>-<i>Natalie, San Ramon</i></h5>

			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
				<h4>Kids Classes</h4>
				<h5>"My 13 year old daughter had her birthday party at Viva Cucina. I couldn’t believe how eager they were to fix their own meal and 
				dessert. I am so proud of her for this achievement and her friends said they had a great time too. The menu is simple yet delicious 
				and easy for them to prepare. They got to sit down and enjoy their meal and open the presents. Having an event at Viva Cucina was much 
				easier than having it at my house."
				<br>-<i>Anne, Alamo</i>
				<br>
				<br>
				"My 13 year old daughter enjoys watching the Food Network and loves cooking. She even helps me prepare dinner sometimes. So when I found 
				Viva Cucina, I booked a class with them and had a great experience. My daughter’s friends were not experienced at cooking, but when they
				worked together to prepare their recipe with the culinary staff, they did very well. My daughter is making these recipes at home now and 
				we love it."
				<br>-<i>Daniel, Diablo</i></h5>

				<h4>Check out our feature in Diablo Magazine</h4>
				<h5>"Viva Cucina’s new cooking class series enlists the aid of San Ramon Valley chefs. Eating your favorite restaurant entrée can be like 
				watching a David Copperfield trick: The food tastes magical, but you wish you knew how the chef did it."
